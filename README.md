The CLI Task Tracker is a simple command-line application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, update, delete, and track the status of tasks (To-Do, In-Progress, and Done). Tasks are stored in a JSON file, making the data persistent across sessions. This project was built using C# .NET and focuses on file handling, user input processing, and CLI interactions.
